newhaze allows you to easily add thousands of games to your website. It also provides social widgets for your site.

== Description ==

newhaze is a great way to manage your games site. It allows you to add thousands of games to your site quickly and easily. The Wordpress plugin lets you manage your newhaze site directly from your Wordpress administration panel. This means that you don't need to bother logging into other websites to edit your site - just log into Wordpress and you're away.

It couldn't be simpler!
